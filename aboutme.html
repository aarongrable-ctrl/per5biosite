  <h1>Here's a little bit about me:</h1>
  <p><img src="images/camping.jpg" width="150px" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border: 5px solid gray; border-radius: 15px; transform: rotate(-5deg);" alt=""/>I am a dedicated educator who blends creativity and technology to prepare students for real-world careers in design and web development. With more than twenty-five years of professional experience in graphic and web design, I bring industry knowledge into every lesson. My background allows me to demonstrate how classroom skills translate directly to professional opportunities and long-term career success. By connecting theory with practice, I help students understand the relevance of their work and inspire them to reach professional goals.</p>

Students design logos, build websites, and create complete branding packages for actual clients, experiencing the same processes used in professional studios. This hands-on approach helps them build strong, competency-based portfolios and earn college credit while still in high school. These experiences give students the confidence and technical expertise to step directly into creative careers or pursue higher education with an advantage.</p>

I encourage teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving so students grow as both designers and thoughtful individuals. By learning to give and receive constructive feedback, they develop adaptability and resilience for a rapidly changing creative economy. Through this combination of technical skill and personal growth, my students are prepared to contribute meaningfully to their communities and to succeed in any path they choose.</p>
